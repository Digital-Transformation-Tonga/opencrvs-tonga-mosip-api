# Installation

This document describes how to setup the integration between OpenCRVS and MOSIP. In this example, we will deploy the [mosip-mock](./packages/mosip-mock), [esignet-mock](./packages/esignet-mock) & [mosip-api](./packages/mosip-api). In a real-world scenario, MOSIP would provide the details we're mocking.
